# Module-10-SVG logo maker

## Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker
Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG fileLinks to an external site.. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the Video Submission GuideLinks to an external site. on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.
